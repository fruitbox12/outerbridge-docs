# Introduction to simplifi

**simplifi** is a cutting-edge, is a revolutionary, low-code/no-code workflow automation platform that is pushing the boundaries of what's possible with on-chain and off-chain integration. Our powerful, open-source platform is designed to empower developers and non-developers alike with its user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface.

## Just Drag and Drop!
There are many awesome automation tools out there, however there isn't one that has the built-in logic of interacting/consuming information from blockchains. Hence, Outerbridge is created to allow people building workflows involving on-chain and off-chain applications, with simple drag and drop interface.

## Increase DevOps and Platform adoption practices in an easy way for Web 3.0
Simplifi supports traditional YAML and JSON workflow markup schemes to provide flexibility and compatibility for users who are more familiar with or prefer traditional CI/Job tools such as GitHub Actions, Ansible, and CloudFormations. These markup schemes allow users to create and manage their workflows using the same syntax and conventions that they are already familiar with, which can make it easier for them to integrate Simplifi into their existing workflow processes.

For example, if a user is accustomed to using GitHub Actions to manage their workflows, they can continue to use the same YAML syntax and conventions to create and manage their workflows in Simplifi. Similarly, if a user is more comfortable using Ansible or CloudFormations, they can use the JSON markup scheme to create and manage their workflows in Simplifi.

The support for traditional markup schemes also allows users to leverage their existing skills and knowledge, which can make it easier for them to adopt Simplifi and start automating their workflows. Additionally, it allows users to interconnect Simplifi to their current workflow tools, by exposing Simplifi workflow as a action or job in their CI/CD pipeline.

## Use cases
Outerbridge primary focus is on web3 developers to automate tasks after smart contracts have been deployed. However it's usage is not limited to just that. Even if you are not a web3 developer, you can still use Outerbridge to automate your tasks using the list of supported apps.
- Monitor smart contract events and functions (e.g: Transfer, Approve) and send notification via Discord, Teams, Slack or Email
- Send notification to Discord server when NFT is minted
- Notify user when a transaction does not get through on-chain
- Triggers automatic top-up if balance (e.g: BNB, ETH, Matic) dropped below certain threshold
