# Introduction to simplifi

**simplifi** is a cutting-edge, is a revolutionary, low-code/no-code workflow automation platform that is pushing the boundaries of what's possible with on-chain and off-chain integration. Our powerful, open-source platform is designed to empower developers and non-developers alike with its user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface.

## Just Drag and Drop!
There are many awesome automation tools out there, however there isn't one that has the built-in logic of interacting/consuming information from blockchains. Hence, Outerbridge is created to allow people building workflows involving on-chain and off-chain applications, with simple drag and drop interface.

## Increase DevOps and Platform adoption practices in an easy way for Web 3.0
Simplifi supports traditional YAML and JSON workflow markup schemes to provide flexibility and compatibility for users who are more familiar with or prefer traditional CI/Job tools such as GitHub Actions, Ansible, and CloudFormations. These markup schemes allow users to create and manage their workflows using the same syntax and conventions that they are already familiar with, which can make it easier for them to integrate Simplifi into their existing workflow processes.

For example, if a user is accustomed to using GitHub Actions to manage their workflows, they can continue to use the same YAML syntax and conventions to create and manage their workflows in Simplifi. Similarly, if a user is more comfortable using Ansible or CloudFormations, they can use the JSON markup scheme to create and manage their workflows in Simplifi.

The support for traditional markup schemes also allows users to leverage their existing skills and knowledge, which can make it easier for them to adopt Simplifi and start automating their workflows. Additionally, it allows users to interconnect Simplifi to their current workflow tools, by exposing Simplifi workflow as a action or job in their CI/CD pipeline.

## Use cases
Simplifi is a cutting-edge, low-code/no-code workflow automation platform that allows users to seamlessly integrate on-chain and off-chain applications. As a Web3-first platform, Simplifi is designed for developers, but also caters to non-developers looking to automate tasks and streamline their workflow. Here are some use cases for Simplifi:

- Monitor and track crypto prices across multiple exchanges, and automatically execute trades when certain conditions are met.
- Automatically mint NFTs and post them on marketplaces such as OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare.
- Automate compliance checks and KYT (know your transaction) for transaction monitoring and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance.
- Monitor real-time sensor data and trigger workflows based on predefined conditions
- Create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with Simplifi and manage it's functions, such as Proposal, Voting, and Token Distribution.
- Integrate Simplifi with a project management tool such as Asana or Trello, triggering tasks, creating cards, and updating statuses in response to on-chain events.
- Create a decentralized, self-sustaining, and autonomous community-driven content distribution platform.
- Monitor and collect data from social media platforms, triggering workflows based on keywords, and sentiment analysis.
