# 🎨 Weave UI

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

📖 Learn More
-------------

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

-   [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
-   [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

🚀 Deploy on Vercel
-------------------

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

📚 App Router Structure
=======================

For more information on the app router structure, visit the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

Routes
------

To learn about defining routes, visit the [Defining Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) section. For information on route handlers, see [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers).

Authentication
--------------

We use NextAuth.js for authentication. Learn more about it [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#in-app-router). Implement Google Auth and other operations such as CRUD for workflows, API keys, wallets, and smart contracts.

Components
----------

Refer to the [Next.js Components Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components) for a comprehensive guide on components.

### Navigation

-   **NavBar**: Threads, Integrations, API Keys, Smart Contracts, Wallets, Teams, User -> Settings
-   **Thread Card**: Card view for threads
-   **Thread Table**: Table view for threads
-   **API Key Card**: Card view for API keys
-   **API Key Table**: Table view for API keys

Pages
-----

Refer to the [Next.js Pages Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages) for more details.

### Dashboard

-   **Auth/Signup & Login with Google**
-   **Dashboard/Threads**
-   **Dashboard/API Keys**
-   **Dashboard/Wallets**
-   **Dashboard/Smart Contracts**
-   **Dashboard/User Settings**
-   **Dashboard/Teams**

Canvas
------

Refer to the [Canvas Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LiMzVoS1tBxk8gkc6LdhkgVvpbm7hH2rMiu1Kujz78w/edit) for more details. Use `useSaveWorkflow` for saving workflows via the `API/workflows POST` endpoint.

User Flow
---------

### Dashboard Flow

User goes to the dashboard and performs conditional checks for `NEW_WORKFLOW_SAVED`. If `NEW_WORKFLOW_SAVED`, unset it and load the current workflows.

### Workspaces Flow

User navigates to workspaces, uses `useWorkspaces` to fetch available workspaces, and creates new workspaces via `POST api/workspaces`.

### Canvas Flow

User creates and saves workflows in the canvas using `useSaveWorkflows` which sets `NEW_WORKFLOW_SAVED`.

Edit Nodes Flow
---------------

Schema for nodes includes actions, credentials, input parameters, networks, and test nodes. Editing nodes involves conditional rendering based on node type.
