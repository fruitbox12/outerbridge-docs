# Weave.Services Platform - Types

This document provides an overview of the types used in the Weave.Services platform, explaining their purposes and how they integrate with various components and modules.

## Types Directory Structure

The `ui/src/types` directory contains type definitions that are used throughout the platform to ensure type safety and consistency. By defining these types, we can enforce a consistent structure for data and prevent many common bugs that arise from incorrect data handling.

### Directory Structure

**Path:** `ui/src/types`

**Files and Subdirectories:**
- `hooks/`
  - Contains type definitions for custom hooks used in the platform.
- `auth.ts`
  - Contains type definitions related to authentication processes and user sessions.
- `editnode.ts`
  - Contains type definitions for editing nodes within the canvas interface.
- `nav.ts`
  - Contains type definitions for navigation elements such as menu items and links.
- `user.ts`
  - Contains type definitions for user-related data and Axios requests/responses.
- `workflow.ts`
  - Contains type definitions for workflows, including nodes and edges.
- `workspace.ts`
  - Contains type definitions for workspaces, encapsulating workflows and user associations.

### Type Definitions and Their Usage

#### `auth.ts`
Contains type definitions related to authentication processes within the platform.

**Example:**
```typescript
// auth.ts
import { CredentialInput } from 'next-auth/providers/credentials'
import { Account, Session, Profile, User } from 'next-auth'
import { JWT } from 'next-auth/jwt'
import { AdapterUser } from 'next-auth/adapters'

export type SignInType = { 
    user: User | AdapterUser, 
    account: Account | null, 
    profile?: Profile, 
    email?: { verificationRequest?: boolean }, 
    credentials?: Record<string, CredentialInput> 
}

export type SessionType = {
    session: Session, 
    token: JWT
}

export type JsonWebTokenType = {
    token: JWT
    user: User | AdapterUser
    account: Account | null
    profile?: Profile
    trigger?: 'signIn' | 'signUp' | 'update'
    isNewUser?: boolean
    session?: any
}
```
**Usage:**

-   **Components:** Used in authentication components such as login and registration forms.
-   **Modules:** Utilized in authentication modules to ensure proper type handling during the auth process.

#### `editnode.ts`

Contains type definitions for editing nodes in the canvas.

**Example:**
```typescript

// editnode.ts
export interface EditNode {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  data: NodeData;
}
```
**Usage:**

-   **Components:** Used in canvas components for editing nodes.
-   **Modules:** Utilized in node management modules to ensure type safety during node editing.

#### `nav.ts`

Contains type definitions for navigation elements.

**Example:**
```typescript
// nav.ts
import { Icons } from '@/modules/shadcn/components/icons'

export interface NavItem {
  title: string;
  href?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
  external?: boolean;
  icon?: keyof typeof Icons;
  label?: string;
  description?: string;
}

export interface NavItemWithChildren extends NavItem {
  items: NavItemWithChildren[];
}

export type SidebarNavItem = NavItemWithChildren;
```
